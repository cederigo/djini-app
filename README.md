* code-push - Push code updates to your apps, instantly. http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/

# Tool requirements

* XCode
* Android SDK with "Google Play Services" and "Google Repositories" installed

# Getting started

How to get up and running for development

* Setup react-native: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
* Edit `PARSE_SERVER_ID` in src/lib/config.js
* npm install
* Run simulator: `react-native run-ios`
* To enable Debugging / Hot Reloading: Shake device / simulator ;-)

## iOS

* Install Xcode

## Android

```bash
$ brew cask install android-sdk
$ sdkmanager "platforms;android-23" "build-tools;23.0.1"
```

# IDE

I recommend Visual studio code with the following plugins:

* React Native Tools
* ESLint
* EditorConfig for VS Code

# Tests

Test coverage is bad. More tests are welcome! `src/lib/__tests__/`

```
$ npm run test
```

or if you want autoreload

```
$ npm run test:watch
```

# Code push - Push code updates to your apps, instantly

Fix Djini bugs instantly. Note: you cant update native code, Only JavaScript and images!

After you release an update the user needs to restart the Djini-App 2 times:

1. App downloads update if necessary
2. App installs downloaded update

Warning: Dont use --mandatory for android users
You can mark an update as "--mandatory" to merge step 1 & 2.

## Setup

* Follow 1 (install) and 2 (register) at http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/
* Ask cre for credentials in step 2

## Release code-push update

Note: Make sure your target binary version (ex. -t 1.0.x) matches the one you are targeting out in the field!

Android:

```
$ code-push release-react djini-Android android -t 1.0.x
```

iOS:

```
$ code-push release-react djini-iOS ios -t 1.0.x
```

If you want to update the target binary version on an existing release (ex 1.0.1):

```
$ code-push patch djini-Android Staging -t 1.0.1
$ code-push patch djini-iOS Staging -t 1.0.1
```

# Bug fixing and test releases

* Fix bugs

## iOS

* Test locally (XCode Simulator)
* Build IOS release in XCode (see below)
* login to itunesconnect.apple.com using Apple Developer Account (ask cre or mfl)
* Test internal (TestFlight => Intern Testen => choose version to test)

## Android

* Test locally (on device)
* Build Android release (see below)
* login to testfairy.com
* New Upload => Upload Android APK

# App store release

Edit the version in the following files (I know, its a pain)

* package.json
* src/lib/config.js
* ios/Djini/Info.plist
* android/app/build.gradle

## iOS - XCode

Build IOS release in XCode

* On the top choose "Generic iOS Device"
* Build archive (Product -> Archive)
* Export../Upload to App Store.. your archive in the Organizer window (Window > Organizer)

## Android

* edit ~/.gradle/gradle.properties (ask cre):

```
  org.gradle.daemon=true
  DJINI_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
  DJINI_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
  DJINI_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=...
  DJINI_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=...
```

* Ask cre for the "signing key" (aka "my-release-key.keystore") => cp to android/app
* Build Android release

```
$ cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

* Upload the final .apk file (android/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk)
